### Do I have water in my basement ?<ht>

<br>
<u>Naive approach</u>

Place a water-sensor in the basement and send me a push notification on my smartphone if it detects moisture.<br>

A single sensor might not be enough! <br>

Place a couple of water-sensors and send me ... <br>

More sensors increase the chance of false positives. <br>

What about a sequence of events: If sensors are signalling one-by-one ... would that be a good indication ?
