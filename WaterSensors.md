### Do I have water in my basement ?<ht>

<br>
#### Naive approach

Place a water-sensor in the basement and send me a push notification on my smartphone if it detects moisture.<br>

A single sensor might not be enough! <br>

#### More-is-better approach  
![More is better](http://www.energy2engage.com/hs-fs/hub/129961/file-296483410-jpeg/images/more_is_better.jpeg?t=1490990984108&width=400&height=300&name=more_is_better.jpeg)

Place a couple of water-sensors and notify me ... <br>

More sensors increase the chance of false positives. <br>

#### Less-is-more approach

What about a sequence of events: If sensors are signalling one-by-one ... would that be a good indicator ?
