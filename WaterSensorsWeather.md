### Will I have water in my basement ?<ht>
<br>

No oracles in IT, so ...

#### Rephrased the question a bit.


What can I do to avoid water where it doesn't belong ?


#### Taking the weather into account
Please let me a notification if my water sensor trigger one-by-one, <br>
but also in case there is a weather warning in effect for my area **AND**<br>
I've left the windows open.<br><br>
Plenty of time to close windows now ..<br>


#### What if the entire family is away on vacation ?
Maybe someone should call my neighbors ...<br>
