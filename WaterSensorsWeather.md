### Will I have water in my basement ?<ht>
<br>

There are no oracles in IT, so ...

#### Let's rephrase the question a bit.


What can I do to avoid water where it doesn't belong ?<br>


#### First, take weather into account

So we get:<br><br>

* Please let me a notification if my water sensor trigger one-by-one,
* but also in case there is a weather warning in effect for my area **AND**
when I've left my windows open.
* Now I should have plenty of time to close windows
<br><br>


#### What if the entire family is away on vacation ?
Maybe someone should call my neighbors ...<br>



#### So edge computing is not enough
At least part of the processing should be done "outside" of my house.
